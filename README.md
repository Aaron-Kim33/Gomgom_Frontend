| `socket.io`                         |  socket.io vs WebSocket <br><br>socket.io uses https to enable real-time data communication using the concept of rooms to open a chat room for each user who enters the room and communicate with each other                                                                                                                          |
| `FCM`                               | Send real-time push notifications when other users interact with your choice post or counseling room to induce active use of the site.|
| `PWA`                               | Introduced to induce web app installation to increase reusability and implement background push notifications.|
| `Redux toolkit`                     | Redux Toolkit vs Recoil <br><br>Introduced a library to efficiently manage global state. <br>We chose redux, which has a large amount of open source as there are many users. <br>Among them, we decided to use redux-toolkit, which makes redux package installation easier and boilerplate much smaller.|
| `Axios`                             | Axios vs JS Fetch API <br><br>Response timeout (fetch does not have this feature) handling method exists <br>It is convenient to handle data because it is based on Promise. <br>Since browser compatibility is better than fetch, it is considered suitable for the Gomgom service that has web apps in mind.  |
| `Styled components`                 | CSS-in-JS vs CSS-in-CSS <br><br>I thought it was an advantage that I could maintain CSS without separating files. <br>Dynamic styling is possible according to props or state. <br>Among them, we decided to use styled                           |
| `S3`<br>`Cloud Front`<br>`Route 53` | vs Vercel<br><br>Vercel is a popular platform for deploying front-end applications, known for its simplicity and ease of use. It offers a streamlined deployment process with minimal configuration required. However, we decided to explore AWS's deployment platforms for several reasons   |
| `Github actions`                    | To facilitate seamless collaboration between the front-end and back-end teams, we implemented automated deployment using GitHub Actions. This allowed us to automate the deployment process, triggering deployments whenever code changes were pushed to the respective repositories.      |

## üî•Trouble Shooting
<details>
<summary> Social Login of Kakao </summary>
<br>

‚ùì Problem

Kakao login information received from the server was displayed on the front-end, but data access was not possible.
Setting the redirect_uri on the front-end to the server side prevented data access on the front-end, while setting it to the front-end local server resulted in a redirect_uri mismatch error.

‚ùóÔ∏è Solution

Research and Investigation:

Consulted Kakao Developers documentation but found it difficult to understand.
Posted inquiries on the Kakao Developers forum regarding CORS, KOE errors (specifically 006 and redirect-related errors), and received responses.
Searched the forum for relevant posts and referred to various resources.
Resolving Redirect_uri Mismatch:

Added redirect_uri to the Kakao login application in Kakao Developers.
Matched the redirect_uri for the front-end and server.
Image of Kakao Developers redirect_uri settings: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107025988/193506725-96668b13-3f76-42c1-850c-d17a24337e8a.png
Additional Fixes:

Modified the callback_url in the server's .env file to point to the front-end server.
Updated the front-end code to redirect to the main page after receiving data and modified the code to receive login data.
Corrected the callback_url in the server to point to the server side, which was preventing data access from the front-end.
Removed the duplicate window.location.replace('/ ') code in the front-end, which was causing an infinite loading loop.
